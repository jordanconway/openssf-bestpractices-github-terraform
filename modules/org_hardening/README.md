# Org Hardening Module

Opinionated organization-level settings aligned with OpenSSF guidance where possible.

Current capabilities (planned):
* Default repository permissions
* Members can create repos toggle
* Allowed repository visibility settings
* Dependabot alerts (org level default)
* GitHub Advanced Security (org level) - NOTE: billing implications
* TODO: Actions allowed actions at org level once provider supports granular config
